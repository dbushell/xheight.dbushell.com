<p>I write a lot about my experiences as a professional Web Designer. <a title="On Design Blogging" href="https://dbushell.com/2010/07/12/on-design-blogging/">Writing helps</a> shape my understanding. Sometimes I’ll start writing on a topic only to realise I know less than I thought I did.</p>
<p>What fascinates me more though is reading what <em>other</em> designers have to say. For that reason I’m planning to <strong>launch a new blog soon!</strong> It will be a collaborative effort, with many authors contributing their thoughts on how <em>they</em> design.</p>
<p>Below is a few paragraphs from the article I’m writing to give you an idea of the style and purpose of this new blog (title still to be decided).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>Trying to describe the direction design takes can be near impossible in the moment. There is no linear step towards a perfect design solution. A synapses fires, triggered by a spontaneous lateral association—often later forgotten—resulting in an idea.</p>
<p>The better the idea, the harder to explain its origin.</p>
<p>Design starts with the obvious solution. A visual pun, a series of related words, a merging of two, or three concepts. Multiply simplicity by the post-obviousness of the final idea and you result in the successfulness of the project. Simplicity is the hardest thing to achieve. Good design makes you think:<em>why didn’t I think of that?</em></p>
<p>In most cases this is good enough. Firstly, because the design insight is fresh – different from what has been done before (at least in the short term memory of consumers). Trends and opinion change with time; a continuous feed for the designer. Design as a whole shifts with technological and social progression. From Modernism to the Contemporary. A few individuals are heralded as visionaries, but even they could not have progressed without the collective design movement; where influence is energy, and inspiration is drawn from all corners.</p>
<p>Revolutionary design comes from a truly unique insight, and they’re hard to come by. For a designer anything less is to some degree disappointing. Striving for perfection is the only way to feel a sense of achievement, to reinvigorate self-confidence (“ego” to others).</p>
<p>Designers must keep up to date with their peers. With the world at their fingertips it’s too easy to become overwhelmed with information, ideas and envy. Ego and self-doubt are different sides of the same coin. On one side is a feeling of immense pride, on the other, a paralyzing sense of inadequacy.</p>
<p>For the most part a professional designer balances somewhere in-between. Content with the coin spinning, uncertain as to which side it will land next, but positive of the amazing opportunities within reach…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
