							<h3>Begin.</h3>
<p>I feel I must begin this slight dissertation on my methods with a confession and a lament. When David approached me to join xheight, my heart grew with excitement and a sense of emotional relief upon the idea of a place whence my more abstract thoughts on design could find residence. These feelings were immediately followed by anxiety. How do I formulate these thoughts into digestible, understandable paragraphs, sentences and words? How can something which resonates so viscerally with me be transcribed in written word?</p>
<p>It has been a full week since that moment, but I think it&#8217;s time I take the bull by the horns and dive deep into what makes me, as my moniker would have it, <em>sick</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<h3>Be consistent.</h3>
<p>I dare say that no design is created the same for me. I have no established method, no exact steps that must be undertaken to achieve good design. Moreover, I dare not create such a system for myself, for if I would, it would, surely, lead to the creation of, for lack of a better term, blocks in my creative path. It would mean restraint and while that would lead to consistency, I do not approve of conscious, forced consistency when it comes to design. But this is not some blind decision, based on an irrational fear of self sabotage.</p>
<p>For all this to make more sense, you need to know a bit more about me. I am, wholeheartedly, skeptical and analytical. I do not believe in things; to me proven facts matter, anything else is just blind, unsupported belief. And, to me, things that cannot be proven, that have no evidence supporting them, are useless. It is a strange fact that I am also inclined to create and dream up things. By all accounts, I shouldn&#8217;t have a creative bone in my body, and yet there is a great part of me that needs to create, every day, without pause. Because of this mind frame, and the nature and duality of design (analysis and art) I must force chaos upon myself, because analysis is my natural go-to tool.</p>
<p>It is a struggle I go through every day and it gives me great self satisfaction whenever I reach that perfect balance between the two sides of me, for when that balance is reached, it is then that I produce <em>sickness</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<h3>Be sick.</h3>
<p>We live in a time when people from thousands of miles away are closer than ever. It is, without a doubt, the greatest conquer of the age of circuitry, and social media is the very pinnacle of this aspect of technology. Unfortunately, we also live in a time when the most common language is English. I say unfortunately because I was not born with the privilege of living in a native English speaking country and, of course, my real name is rather difficult to pronounce, let alone remember, for a native English speaker. I was, therefore, forced to choose a name, a moniker, an easy to remember and representative wording of who I am, as many others in my situation have and will for as long as the world will speak different languages.</p>
<p>I chose the word <em>sick</em> because of it&#8217;s dual meaning. Colloquially, it is both good and bad, it can be an expression of supreme quality, and also of disgust. While my intention has never been to produce disgust, I am attracted to its curious duality. <em>Sickdesigner </em>is easy to remember, short, poignant and descriptive, all of which are qualities that I was looking for.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p>Armed with my chaotic approach, I try, every day, to stay true to my assumed name. I constantly ask myself<em> is this sick?</em> and I rely on perseverance more than anything else to help me reach the point where I can say <em>yes, Radu, this is sick</em>.</p>

								<p>If any designer has ever wondered why this profession has been taken less and less seriously over the years &#8211; it&#8217;s simply because of this kind of self-indulgent behavior.</p>
<p>If designers stopped obsessing about how creative they are and started focusing on the business of being creative &#8211; we would live in a world where designers were certified and not cutting each others throats over a few bucks an hour.</p>

								<p>Hey Chuck &#8211; are we not allowed to enjoy design and share thoughts and ideas from our own experience? How does that in anyway relate to cutting throats over a few bucks?</p>
<p>You seem to be the kind that think writing about yourself is automatically self-indulgent. I&#8217;ve got news for you mate &#8211; most designers enjoy what they do. They&#8217;re inspired by ideas from others. They improve by learning from others. They aspire to help others.</p>
<p>Should we shut up and be negative like you, and sit in our own little world of business? Or should we step aside every now and then; share our experience with each other?</p>
<p>Is there an element of self-promotion here? Sure. So what? If you don&#8217;t like it the problem is with you, not everyone else. Get some perspective, enjoy what you do without hating on others. If you don&#8217;t want to collaborate &#8211; don&#8217;t. If you don&#8217;t want to discuss design &#8211; don&#8217;t. But holding such a negative opinion on those that do is only harmful to yourself.</p>

								<p>I know I am pulling this quote out of context, but &#8220;analysis and art&#8221; is an amazing definition of design.</p>

								<p>didn&#8217;t really get anything at all from this article &#8211; there are design principles that do give a designer a base without stifling their creativity &#8211;  pulling from fine art movements can lead to inspiration, talented designers like David Carson, talks by paul rand etc, there&#8217;s a lot to be pulled from out there .(without resorting to plagiarism)<br />
the  Radu article was not very inspiring.<br />
