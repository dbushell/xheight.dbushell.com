<p>I always liked to believe that I was meant for a lot more than what my societies perception of life thought it should be like. I come from a culture with very little appreciation for passion and the arts, and from a very young age I knew deep down in my heart that I was meant for much greater things than this. An entire world of countries, continents, cultures, and coastlines was in front of me. Surely I can make a difference. I have a purpose. Surely. But how?</p>
<p>Life was more than just life. Design is more than just design.</p>
<p>I often find myself thinking about the importance of good design, and I always jump to the conclusion that it is probably single-handedly the most important aspect of any project. Why you may ask? Well, because we are human, and as humans we tend to judge others on first impressions (the first three minutes are the most important). I believe that the same is for design.</p>
<p>A nicely designed site and/or product can show off the quality of content, your loyalty towards customers, as well as a strong appreciation for your craft within the first couple of seconds. Design is often what will introduce your viewers/customers/users to your product/service/site… so obviously first impressions count, right? Right. This is really important to understand.</p>
<p>But what is it that makes a good designer?</p>
<p>I am very convinced that the the worlds best designers are those who have  a very specific purpose for each and every project. They want to solve the worlds problems whilst making it a better place to live in. The worlds best designers are visionaries who take on each and every single project as if it was their own. They thrive on passion and are inspired by the idea that they can make a difference in peoples lives.</p>
<p>Design is all about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing what you love.</li>
<li>Having purpose.</li>
<li>Not being afraid to fail.</li>
<li>Staying positive.</li>
<li>Having faith.</li>
<li>Falling in love.</li>
<li>Respecting yourself.</li>
<li>Sharing your knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, of course it is important to understand that practice of ones craft is important, but anyone can practice anything. Design is more than just practice. Design is a life style. Not everyone is born a designer.</p>
<p>Good design is in the conversations we have, the people we meet, the passions we share, the experiences we have had, in our angers and fears. Good design should be able to make a difference. Good design should have a purpose. I believe in good design.</p>
<p>Design is life.</p>

								<p>I like your article, but there&#8217;s one thing that I find irrelevant. It&#8217;s this &#8221; I come from a culture with very little appreciation for passion and the arts&#8221;. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re in a position to make such an assumption. Look back to what Moroccan Architecture and designs have added to the world civilization.<br />
 I guess you wanted to say that Moroccans nowadays don&#8217;t have as much appreciation of arts as they did before? if that&#8217;s what you meant, I agree. You could have just made it clearer to avoid humbling your own culture.</p>

								<p>Hello Imane! First of all, thank you for your comment. Feedback is always great, positive or negative. You know, I believe that no one loves Morocco more than I do, and in no way am I trying to be offensive to our country. I am simply speaking the truth based on what I see, hear, and understand. And when I speak about my culture, I am obviously speaking about the present in a very personal way which I believe is necessary information in order for the readers to understand where I am coming from! I am not trying to belittle my country, but the truth is that there really is very little appreciation for the arts. I would really love it if you could prove me wrong. Although, I think that things have started to change, which is a good thing!</p>

								<p>Here is something that really stuck with me in my school days. One of my teachers made the point of saying that, as a designer, you must always be thinking. Thinking in the car, thinking in the shower, thinking as you live. These thoughts are important as they develop your mind as a designer and help to keep fresh ideas flowing out of you. They help you to connect everyday life (and not so everyday) with ideas that you can use.</p>
<p>This was a profound thing for me. At the time, I thought this was too much. However, as I progressed into the real world, I was doing this without even realizing it. It engulfs you. Design really is life for the enthusiastic designer. And it can be a beautiful thing as you develop a deeper appreciation for the world around you.</p>
<p>Thanks for this article, Karim. I think you laid out the minds of several visionaries among us.</p>

								<p>I strongly agree with your point that designers “want to solve the worlds problems whilst making it a better place to live in.” The most successful businesses in the world are those that saw a need or a problem and offered a solution. This is definitely how a successful designer should look at each project that comes across the desk, whether a simple design for business cards or a consuming design for an entire campaign.</p>

								<p>Guess I&#8217;m the lone person out here that thinks this is rubbish. What you&#8217;re talking about isn&#8217;t specific to design, it&#8217;s about being successful in what you do. Obviously, this is my opinion and I&#8217;m going to make people mad, but that&#8217;s OK; there&#8217;s far too much, &#8220;Oh this is so wonderful&#8221; in these comments. </p>
<p>Think about it, really think about it. You&#8217;re not talking about design, you&#8217;re romanticizing. I could take the same things you&#8217;ve said an apply them to anything. Everything you mention is about how to be happy and successful, it&#8217;s not unique to design. To me this is just another &#8220;article&#8221; by someone who is way too enamored with some romantic idea about design, for others who are way to enamored with the same idea. </p>
<p>Designers, you are not unique. </p>
<p>This &#8220;we&#8217;re so awesome, and in touch with the the human condition&#8221; garbage is just that, garbage. I write code all day, there isn&#8217;t anything that you&#8217;ve said that isn&#8217;t true about what I do. And at the same time, just because you call yourself a designer doesn&#8217;t mean you approach your life and work in the way you describe. </p>
<p>Designers aren&#8217;t special. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not knocking the immense value of designers, don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m just saying that you&#8217;re giving yourself too much credit. Design isn&#8217;t life. Design is *your* life, and that&#8217;s only because you&#8217;re passionate about it. Life is whatever you&#8217;re passionate about. Don&#8217;t try to rob that from the rest of us.</p>

								<p>True, this philosophy could be applied to any profession &#8211; and what&#8217;s wrong with that? Sure, it&#8217;s idealistic and romantic &#8211; does that mean we have to reject it?</p>
<p>You even say it yourself &#8220;Life is whatever you’re passionate about&#8221;, but you&#8217;re mistaking this article for trying to &#8220;steal&#8221; an idea for designers alone. It&#8217;s written from a certain perspective, but it&#8217;s most definitely about one designers life, as you&#8217;ve recognised.</p>
<p>Design is about creating an emotional connection to inanimate objects. Of course designers are going explore these ideas.</p>
<p>You seem to have an issue with designers in general, not people being passionate about their work.</p>

								<p>I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s wrong that this philosophy can be applied to any profession. I&#8217;m saying it&#8217;s wrong to approach an article such as this and imply that this philosophy is unique to design. When you make the statement &#8220;Design is life&#8221; you are also making the statement that &#8220;Not-design is not-life.&#8221; When you list a bunch of things that &#8220;Design is all about&#8221;, you&#8217;re trying to separate out design and use those attributes to uniquely identify it. You can&#8217;t do that without &#8220;stealing&#8221; those ideals from other areas. Those things aren&#8217;t unique to design, but often I see designers make statements that imply that they are.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I have a problem with designers, I have a problem with this kind of thing from anywhere; I just see it more in the design world than anywhere else. I&#8217;m glad the author approaches things in this way, but this article implies that this type of approach is unique to design, and it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>My other issue, which I didn&#8217;t really touch on, is that a post like this is of no real value to the design community. If you&#8217;re a designer, and are passionate about it, these things aren&#8217;t news to you. If you&#8217;re me, you read this and think that this guy is full of himself and thinks passion, positivity, self-respect and the desire to share knowledge is unique to design. As someone who feels equally passionate about my craft, I feel cheated.</p>

								<p>Saying &#8220;Design is life,&#8221; is not the same as saying &#8220;Design is fun.&#8221; So that comparison is invalid. </p>
<p>As to your second point, of course you found it inspiring as did many other people. That&#8217;s fine. Everybody likes to see that someone shares the same viewpoint as they do. Would I call that inspiring? No. Reaffirming? Yes. Not the same thing, but still I can appreciate it. My point is that this isn&#8217;t new. Nothing the author has said is new and therefore adds nothing to the overall conversation of design. Not to mention, he&#8217;s preaching to the choir. What is the point of an article about how awesome design is when the audience is a bunch of people who think design is super awesome?</p>
<p>Pardon me for not jumping on the bandwagon and rather providing my opinion of the article. In the future I will be sure to either, a) not read this blog, or b) only comment when I have totally worthless comments like &#8220;Totally agree&#8221;, or &#8220;Me too&#8221;, or &#8220;Great post&#8221;&#8230;since those are so much better than having a difference of opinion and genuine debate about a topic. I&#8217;ll probably go with &#8220;a&#8221;.</p>

								<p>The essence&#8230; for each individual you must excerpt the essence of the article and apply it to your situation or specific passion.  I didn&#8217;t gather so much that the author was implying design rules the world and all other things pale in comparison as much as he was conveying his enthusiasm/passion for design.</p>
<p>I found it inspirational&#8230; and could easily apply it to Soccer (Futbol), Web Design, or Business in general. C&#8217;mon this is easy&#8230;<br />
Design (Soccer Coach, Soccer Player, Web Designer, Entrepreneur) is all about:<br />
    * Doing what you love.<br />
    * Having purpose.<br />
    * Not being afraid to fail.<br />
    * Staying positive.<br />
    * Having faith.<br />
    * Falling in love.<br />
    * Respecting yourself.<br />
    * Sharing your knowledge.</p>

								<p>Well said Karim. Good design shud definitely have purpose. Owing to many different parameters like deadlines, monetary stuff etc we tend to get a little complacent. But that inner drive to excel is very important to get a strong hold&#8230;</p>

								<p>Your launch is centered from the right values but I would add that the statement &#8220;design is life&#8221; is far too simple a term and lacks depth to the overall reality that&#8230;<br />
<i>All things are by design.</i><br />
<i>All things have a purpose.</i><br />
<i>All things, by nature, are ordered.</i><br />
Even Picasso&#8217;s paintings have design, purpose, and order. So maybe &#8220;Life is by Design&#8221; may be more apropos.</p>
