							<p>Have you ever heard the phrase, &#8220;No news is good news.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Well it&#8217;s not true.</strong></p>
<p>As a freelance designer, this statement couldn&#8217;t be scarier. The idea suggests that not hearing about a situation implies that nothing bad has happened. Designers: you know that feeling, right? It&#8217;s been two weeks since you sent those designs over to your client. You haven&#8217;t heard anything yet and you don&#8217;t know if you should be worried or irritated. Did they hate them? Are they just gathering feedback? I&#8217;m not going to get the rest of my payment, am I? No news is bad news.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the other side. You&#8217;ve hired this great designer and you&#8217;ve paid their required 50% deposit. But it&#8217;s been three weeks now and this designer won&#8217;t respond to any of your emails. Their phone goes straight to voicemail. Maybe she&#8217;s sick? I hope he&#8217;s not dead. I&#8217;m not going to get that money back, am I? No news is bad news.</p>
<p>This happens WAY TOO OFTEN. I think I can speak for both sides when I say that it&#8217;s <em>really difficult</em> to trust after a business relationship goes sour. So here&#8217;s my advice: <strong>respect each other</strong>. If you don&#8217;t respect someone, don&#8217;t work with them! It&#8217;s simple.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="/2011/04/21/the-design-disconnect/" target="_blank">Ross quoted Dan Stiles</a> and referenced the concept of <em>design as a service</em> versus <em>design as an art</em>. That&#8217;s what most of us are doing, right? Offering a service? Whether you&#8217;re working for a firm or freelancing as a sole proprietor, you need to take responsibility as a professional. Stop blaming your &#8220;Type B personality,&#8221; your clients, or how your mother failed to raise and teach you manners.</p>
<p>So how, as designers, can we keep the communication going strong? How can we make sure we&#8217;re getting feedback and compensation?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delegate</strong>: This is something that I&#8217;ve been learning a lot about lately. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a one-person freelance business or a firm comprised of five individuals, you need to delegate. If you love designing/creating/inventing then maybe you shouldn&#8217;t be the bookkeeper. Don&#8217;t spread yourself too thin. It&#8217;s easier to let client relationships slip if you&#8217;re trying to take on six different roles.</li>
<li><strong>Have a life</strong>: We tend to be nicer, as humans, when we take time for ourselves and maintain healthy lifestyles. Go on vacation. Schedule dinner dates. Romance your significant other. Have a hobby.</li>
<li><strong>Stay Accountable</strong>: Find someone to keep you accountable. Are you staying true to your goals? Are you letting others take advantage of you? Is your attitude a positive one? Chatting with a fellow designer is a great way to stay focused.</li>
<li><strong>Create a Contract</strong>: It&#8217;s for both the client and the designer. It protects the client-designer relationship while you&#8217;re working on the project. Use language that makes sense and include things that are important to you (and things you&#8217;ve learned over the years).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just tips. Not an all inclusive list. And when things go sour with a client? All you can do is learn. Perhaps the issue can be worked out but if it cannot, respect yourself enough to move forward and move on.</p>

								<p>Great article.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very important to respect the client and understand that they are &#8220;the client&#8221;, with all their funny ideas!</p>
<p>Sadly the client won&#8217;t always respect you from the start. That&#8217;s where instilling confidence comes into play. Professionalism, understanding and authority to the design process will build it.</p>
