							<h3>Begin</h3>
<p>Hey, there, stranger! Boy, you wouldn&#8217;t believe the day I just had at work. I work at a web agency, you see. Yeah, I&#8217;m the designer. And depending on who you ask, I have the good or bad fortune of being the only one there in a sea of programmers. But that&#8217;s not what I wanted to tell you about. Today was one of those days when our clients decided to  have the most moronic, unpractical revisions. And not just one client. Three of them! In the same day!<br />
I bet you get days like that sometimes, no? Days when client stupidity seems to flow like the damn Nile, for Pete&#8217;s sake. And the worse part is that they won&#8217;t listen to reason, either. It&#8217;s what they want and you have to push those pixels, &#8217;cause, hey, we all have to eat and pay our bills, right?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Enough lamenting, though. Here&#8217;s the deal: we&#8217;re designers. We do work for clients. So, then, why is it that the vast majority of us, myself included, feel like we have to amputate one of our own limbs when clients ask for revisions that we think are unreasonable? It&#8217;s their product and it&#8217;s their own doing. And, usually, client revisions, are focused on a few specific areas of the design, not the whole thing, so it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re just puppets with a graphics tablet. And even if that were the case, we still get paid for all that initial, pre-revisioned, work.</p>
<p>This got me thinking. Ok, I&#8217;ll admit it, it got me introspecting. Because I did, actually, have one of those days today and even after all these years of designing for clients, I still get just as frustrated about this stuff. Could it be &#8230; ? Could I be designing not for the client, but for myself? But why would I do that?! I never play any other role in my client work, other than designer, so there&#8217;s no extra interest. Is there some sort of emotional attachment between my work and myself? If so, why?</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the more I can&#8217;t avoid the obvious conclusion that this is the kind of attitude that an artist has towards his/her work. Which is a bit frightening, really, because I, genuinely, believe that designers are not artists. I guess it&#8217;s time to reconsider this premise.</p>
<p>But, perhaps, we&#8217;re something different. Perhaps we are not, in fact, artists of any kind. Maybe it&#8217;s just our own selfish, self aggrandizing  personalities at play here and we care about our work simply because it&#8217;s ours, with no real emotional connection, such as an artist would have.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>What about you? Do you Hulk-out when a client demands unreasonable revisions? Are you an artist or an egomaniac? Or maybe there&#8217;s a third option here, as yet unexplored.</p>
<p><em>What say you, designer?</em></p>

								<p>At my last job I did Hulk-out about stupid revisions and I got to the point where I was feeling uncomfortable if a client did not agree with my thoughts on a project. Looking back now i believe it was all about ego and it is absolutely crucial for a designer to always say: &#8220;Lol that looks silly, I can make it much more better&#8221; because at the end of the day this is what makes us good in what we do. I&#8217;d say I am an egomaniac guy who likes designing stuff.<br />
Great article!</p>

								<p>If you as a home owner tell the architect to make a structurally unsound house, of course he&#8217;s going to have a problem with it! You&#8217;re forcing him to make a shoddy craft and insulting his expertise. Why is it that people treat designers any differently? Maybe some designers make it about ego, but certainly not all and not in all cases.</p>

								<p>Good read Radu, thanks for the article!</p>
<p>I think a lot of it boils down to respecting the client, building rapport and instilling confidence.</p>
<p>Sean points to a good analogy in his comment about the architect/builder having authority &#8211; in this example their expertise are obvious to everyone and aren&#8217;t questioned. In design this is not so obvious, everyone thinks they have a good eye for design but they ignore many less obvious factors. Frustration happens in all industries though. If you&#8217;ve every watched Channel 4&#8242;s TV show &#8220;Grand Designs&#8221; you&#8217;ll see a lot of friction between architect and client when ideas get lost and communication breaks down.</p>
<p>The third option would be taking a long, deep breath and make the client happy (while getting your own way!). A skill I haven&#8217;t mastered yet :)</p>

								<p>Great thoughts, Radu.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, the client has a deeper insight into his target audience than the designer/agency, no matter how much research we do. If you flip the &#8220;insight coin&#8221; over, you&#8217;ll see that the designer always has the better eye for design. Just as every project should have a balance between the needs of the audience versus the needs of the design, the designer should find a balance between ego and humility. Dare I say, an ego is important for a designer. It frees his creativity and encourages ingenuity. He just needs to know when to listen and reign in his creative beast.<br />
That&#8217;s easier said than done, I know. I hulk out every now and then – I just can&#8217;t help it!</p>

								<p>I don&#8217;t think you should say designers aren&#8217;t artist. In a way we all are. It&#8217;s more about what you bring to the project than only backing up on a client demands.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t give a vision to your client you&#8217;re just some kind of replaceable executant, not a creative.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re a good designer, you feel like someone is asking you to twist your vision anytime they ask for modifications (but some are necessary).</p>

								<p>You&#8217;re hired for a task. You make carefully-considered decisions towards the best outcome for your task. If somebody keeps telling you how you should be doing it, it is straight annoying. A plumber, electrician, carpenter, mechanic, absolutely anyone would be annoyed in the same way.<br />
If however, the two of you sat down and had a discussion about the future of the project and where it needs to be going, it would be fruitful and positive for the project – both your objectives…</p>

								<p>I agree. Clients can be a headache, but I think its the balance of being proud of your work and understanding your providing a service for the client. Yea most of us went to school for design and when the client gives a design change we feel insulted. In all&#8230; it&#8217;s usually not worth your time and energy to turn into the hulk and mope because a client wanted something that is ridiculous.</p>

								<p>Pretty much &#8220;Yes&#8221;, in a nut shell. Its annoying, but I&#8217;ve also made some much better sites in that situation. It hurt to admit it, but their idiotic ideas can (sometimes) help.</p>
<p>Also had sites ruined by clients&#8230;</p>
