							&ldquo;Good design speaks for itself, but it doesn't always speak for you.&rdquo;
						</blockquote>
												<div class="text">
							<p>We have many platforms online to share our design work. Is sharing really self promotion though? You can get your work out there in a controlled space like a personal website, or in more social arenas like <a title="LoveDsgn" href="http://lovedsgn.com" target="_blank">LoveDsgn</a> or <a title="Dribbble" href="http://dribbble.com" target="_blank">Dribbble</a>, but how many viewers remember who you are? They see and love your design—maybe even <em>like</em> or <em>+1</em> it—and then move on.</p>
<p>It takes time and regularity to build up a reputation in peoples memory. Keeping a consistency across profiles is an often overlooked virtue. Avatars are more memorable than names. Use more than one or change it too often and you&#8217;ve created a new profile; you&#8217;re back to anonymity. You need the same profile across multiple sites to become recognisable. Once established, iterate on what works and leave behind what doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>This is the basics of self promotion we all learn when starting out online. It&#8217;s about creating a face—a brand, if you like—that represents <em>you</em>.</p>
<h2>Design speaks for itself</h2>
<p>Good design speaks for itself, but it doesn&#8217;t always speak for you.</p>
<p>It may catch the eye and <a title="Design for Clients - xheight - ideas on design" href="/2011/06/13/design-for-clients/" target="_blank">serve the client</a> but it doesn&#8217;t help promote you personally. The accompanying profile may permeate the viewer&#8217;s mind after multiple exposures but on the majority of websites you&#8217;re lost in a vast ocean of talent. Sites that allow user-submitted content have designers in their thousands (millions if you count Twitter et al). Curated galleries offer more promotion, but most of these hold small value when featured design is shipped in and out with the &#8220;daily inspire&#8221; post.</p>
<p>Getting your own work out there is easy. It&#8217;s even easier to find incredibly good design from others on the web. Finding an interesting <em>designer</em> however, is much harder. Good design is not enough. You need ideas, opinions, enthusiasm and advice to offer.</p>
<p>I want <em>you</em> to speak to me, not your design.</p>
<p>I advocate a strong Twitter presence and personal design blog alongside your portfolio. (There&#8217;s no point running a Tumblr blog if no one associates it with you.) Build up a set of core profiles to output your creative ideas. Use other websites to draw viewers back to your main profile.</p>
<p>Self promotion is not about pushing an ego onto others, it&#8217;s simply about making yourself visible and accessible.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>I asked a couple of <strong>xheight</strong> authors to share their thoughts on self promotion:</p>
<h3><a title="Allison Lehman" href="/author/allison.lehman/">Allison Lehman</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>I would say self-promotion doesn&#8217;t have to be this formal, structured plan. I think it&#8217;s how you incorporate your passions into your daily life. I&#8217;m promoting myself on Twitter, out in public, networking, on forums, and my involvement within the design community. Sure, handing out my business card is a traditional form of self-promotion but what about my conversation with that person 10 minutes before I do that?</p></blockquote>
<h3><a title="Karim Boubker" href="/author/karim.boubker/">Karim Boubker</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>Self promotion is all about balance and character. It&#8217;s about being able to identify and better yourself as a person. It allows others to to know who you are as a person on a deeper more personal level, rather than just what you can do. This is important.</p></blockquote>
<p>The common theme here is promote yourself not your design, we can already see that.</p>
<p>Please tell us what you think. Leave a comment below.</p>

								<p>Great article. You are right, its best to take part in online conversations as much as possible to get your name across and help people recognize you&#8230; For some reason, without ever working with you, if people know your name, they are more opt to do work with you even without work examples in some cases.</p>
<p>Great article. Thank you for the read.</p>

								<p>I think &#8220;self promotion&#8221; it&#8217;s all about having your own thoughts, ideas and opinions and getting them out there in the web community. Branding is important too, keep your personal branding consistent so that people will recognize you when they see your logo or avatar. Meeting new creative people and learning from them is also a big part of the fun. =)</p>

								<p>David,</p>
<p>This is a really great article. Thanks. I&#8217;ve been struggling this past year to get my name out. I&#8217;ve been changing my avatar at least once a month. I&#8217;m slowly learning all these social tools and trying to get my self out there in the online community more. I&#8217;m still trying to find my style. I haven&#8217;t designed in a long time. been focusing on code the past 5 years. I missed designing, and now more than ever, design is in hot demand again. See ya around the internets.</p>
