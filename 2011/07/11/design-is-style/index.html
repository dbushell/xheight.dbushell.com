							<p>As a kid I was extremely fascinated by the internet and would always try to use it as much as I possibly could. The younger generations wouldn&#8217;t really understand this, but back then the internet was limited, slow, expensive, and with little purpose. I would have to disconnect the phone line in order to &#8216;go online&#8217;, which always caused problems with my family. I would be lucky if I could use the internet for more than an hour each week. It was exclusive&#8230;a novelty if you wish.</p>
<p>Today it is a big part of my identity. And it will only get bigger.</p>
<p>When I think back, it&#8217;s hard to remember what exactly I would use the internet for. I very faintly remember looking for groups to chat with on mirc, searching for game cheats, and doing basic research. There was no Facebook, no Twitter, and MSN was still a new concept. Many of the things that make the internet what it is today did not exist yet, and most importantly, or to me at least, there was a missing design element. And design is important.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>I truly believe that design is all about style. It really is.</p>
<p>This is not to say that practice is irrelevant, because IT IS NOT. It&#8217;s just that style and taste are what really makes a designer unique and stand out of the crowd. Unlike many other passions and professions where intense practice is all that is necessary to become the best of your craft, design is an art form, and as such, technical abilities can only take you so far.</p>
<p>Design is all about the individual and expression plays a big role in that. Its the cumulation of every single thing that person has seen and done from the very first moment they&#8217;ve opened their eyes up until that very moment. This is what develops style, and according to the person, they may or may not have a taste that is relevant to that of the design world.</p>
<p>At least that is what I think.</p>
<p>Now of course, technical abilities are necessary, and being able to combine this unique style with hours of practice and hard work is what I believe differentiates the average from the best. This is what makes a design classic.</p>
<p>We need more classic design.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
<p>Today, of course, I see things differently. You can literally connect to the internet from almost anywhere, it&#8217;s fast, cheap, and with a lot of purpose. There is a lot of emphasis on good design and many people goes as far as to make it a priority. Things are different now and I couldn&#8217;t be happier.</p>
<p>Why you may ask?</p>
<p>Because it gives me hope. It gives me hope of a future where every single aspect of the web will be designed beautifully right down to the smallest detail. It gives me hope that the kids of our generation will continue to be inspired by these improvements.</p>
<p>It will encourage them. And most importantly, allow them to develop a style of their own. Because well&#8230;</p>
<p>Design is Style.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not.</p>
<p>But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit.</p>
<p>Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story.</p>
<p>It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile.</p>
<p>You’ve just gotta fight your way through.</p>

								<p>I think you&#8217;ve taken that Ira Glass quote out of context. Taste and style are two very different things. Style is the accent we have when we speak, taste is deciding which of those words we will let out. We can hardly control our accents, and in that sense, yes, we all have our own &#8216;style&#8217;. This to me, and probably just me, is where a difference comes up between style and voice. </p>
<p>Design is about the individual, but the designer is not that individual. The individual is the audience member who reads or holds or navigates the messages behind what we&#8217;ve put together.</p>
<p>But please don&#8217;t misunderstand me, I&#8217;m not disagreeing, I&#8217;m just suggesting that there is a heck of a lot more to being a great designer, closing that gap, then simply developing your own style (or voice ;)).</p>
<p>And, for me anyway, when Glass talks of closing the gap in our taste, that translates to the designer as being closing the gap between providing solutions, providing good solutions and then, finally, and this is when you hit it, providing the right solutions, especially when the original question is faulty.</p>
<p>Would love to hear your response on my thoughts :)</p>

								<p>It&#8217;s an interesting thought, because while I&#8217;m a believer in removing subjective personal opinion and designing for the &#8220;masses&#8221;, my style is what makes me unique. I suppose if my tastes align with what is necessary everything will be good.</p>
<p>I also think that a designer can very much apply their own style in everything they do and still produce something appropriate for their brief. I don&#8217;t think personality can ever be turned off (nor should it).</p>

								<p>Hey Alexander! Thanks a lot for your comment&#8230; it&#8217;s always nice to hear what other people think about the things I write. I think you have a good point in that I took the quote out of context, but I wasn&#8217;t really trying to validate the quote&#8230; rather, it inspired me to write this article.</p>
<p>I really do believe though that the designer is indeed the individual&#8230; you know? Just as David mentions, you should never turn off your personality when you design, because well&#8230; that is what makes your work different from the rest.</p>
<p>I think that there should always be a little bit of the designer in every piece of work, but developing your own style rather than imitating others can take a lot of time and work&#8230; which was kind of the point I was trying to make!</p>
<p>Anyways, my main point is that I was inspired by the quote, my article wasn&#8217;t based on it!</p>
<p>Thanks for the comment!</p>

								<p>No one should worry about style, you can&#8217;t get rid of it, your work will always look like you, no matter how much you steal or copy. Style is the sum of your mistakes and there will always be plenty</p>

								<p>I disagree, because well&#8230; a unique and original style takes time to find. You practice, you copy others, and then you discover your own style.. or at least this is what I think!</p>

								<p>Haha, when I read that first part, it brought me flashbacks about when I used the internet (AOL &amp; NetZero) and when people would call, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to get through because I was surfing the web.</p>
<p>Well, just wanted to say that you did a great job on the article. I absolutely loved the quote from Ira Glass as well. But I&#8217;m with Alex on this one. There definitely is a lot more that goes with design than just style. Nevertheless, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s just one definition of design and we all have our own ways of defining it.</p>

								<p>Haha, i&#8217;m glad I could take you back to the old days! And yeah, I agree, there is a lot more to design than just &#8216;style&#8217;, but I just think that it is an interesting concept because when you start talking about style&#8230; you are talking about designers as individuals&#8230; about what made them develop a certain style&#8230; and that fascinates me!

								<p>I love exploratory articles like this debating taste and style. I&#8217;ve written one myself which I think agrees with yours in some ways.</p>
<p><a href="http://aentan.com/design/creativity-is-good-taste/" rel="nofollow">http://aentan.com/design/creativity-is-good-taste/</a></p>
<p>As a designer, I&#8217;ve worked hard to improve myself in the way Glass describes, incrementally. I&#8217;m already starting to produce work which doesn&#8217;t disappoint my tastes. But there is another aspect of this. Amidst the years of incrementally getting better at what I do, I&#8217;ve had &#8220;leaps&#8221; which were a result of some major inspiration. When I have them, it feels like I&#8217;ve awakened some part of my mind or opened up new perspective and it often leads me to do big things, life-changing things like starting a company, learning a new programming language, a new way of working. I believe this kind of enlightenment is more likely for those with innate good taste and it is the presence of this internal capacity marrying the right external forces which produces the magical enlightening.</p>
<p>Alex (Retinart): I just realized I forgot to send you the bookmarks I told you I&#8217;m gonna. My bad! Let me get them out this week. I really want you to have them.</p>

								<p>I&#8217;m going to have to disagree. While I do believe that style is important, especially developing your own unique style&#8211;that is not what design is about. Design is about creating solutions that fit a client&#8217;s needs. If you&#8217;re creating solely to fulfill your aesthetic desires you are not designing, you are creating artwork.</p>
<p>The best designers are those who both solve their clients&#8217; problems and satisfy both their aesthetic desires and the client&#8217;s. Being able to craft an art direction that fits the client is far more important than crafting one that matches up to my personal aesthetic tastes.</p>

								<p>I think I should probably better explain what I mean about style and voice.</p>
<p>Style is what you employ because it&#8217;s hip or because you&#8217;re aiming specifically at a certain market, it&#8217;s not a natural notch on your evolution as a creative. It&#8217;s a fad that you&#8217;re jumping on; to me, this is style.</p>
<p>But I think what you&#8217;re talking about when it comes to a &#8216;personal style&#8217; is, for me, better thought of as your voice. It&#8217;s just the natural progression of where your tastes go, regardless of what&#8217;s popular at the moment. It&#8217;s the culmination of all the ideas and questions you&#8217;ve asked yourself as a creative, so anyone familiar with your history, of what you&#8217;ve learned and spoken of in the past, can tell that you&#8217;re using what you&#8217;ve picked up along the way and expressing it anew. This is how, as Glass says, you produce a great volume of work, one which is yours alone.</p>
<p>So in that sense, no, you can&#8217;t disconnect yourself from your own voice (personal style), as it&#8217;s just who you are. I remember a few years ago when grunge got MASSIVE, and there were a few designers who were really well regarded as being masters at the style. But for them, it was just the kind of work they were doing before grunge was a fad, and they&#8217;ve continued to do it since. It&#8217;s just that what was their voice become stylistically popular for a moment. They weren&#8217;t stylists, they were just them.</p>
<p>I make the distinction because a voice can exist in multiple styles. Most of the work that comes out of Pentagram looks like Pentagram work, I can normally spot a Frost piece of design because he&#8217;s one of my favorite designers. Same with Paul Rand or Jan Tschichold – I can look at their work and ID it as theirs (more Tschichold, but I digress) – I can just hear their voices when I see their work, but it&#8217;s not as if every thing they each produced looks the same.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, I think Chris hit it on the head. You have to solve the client&#8217;s problems while creating aesthetic work – what kind of aesthetic you put into the work will just happen because, well, you&#8217;re sense of aesthetic is individual. So it&#8217;ll have your voice.</p>
<p>Wow David, you&#8217;ve built up a great community here :)</p>
<p>No Stress Aen, you were doing me the favour anyway!</p>

								<p>I never said that one should create solely to fulfill their aesthetic desires. I meant that the best designers out there are the ones who are able to develop a unique style and bring that with them to their work. Obviously they must create solutions that fit a client&#8217;s needs, but they mustn&#8217;t lose themselves in the process. Because at the end of the day, if that was the case&#8230; every designer would be the same. Why would a client choose you over someone else? Because they like your style and they believe that your personality matches what they are looking for&#8230;</p>
