							<p>I&#8217;m a designer. Sometimes I try to be a developer. Other times I&#8217;m asked to be an illustrator. There are even scenarios where I get hired by a client and am expected to be a calligrapher. Hopefully, no matter how many roles I&#8217;m juggling, I will always be considered a teacher. I&#8217;m not talking about anything formal. I did not study art education or go to grad school to become a college professor. I simply want to be someone that constantly shares the knowledge that&#8217;s been given to me.</p>
<p>There are three key &#8220;teacher&#8221; relationships that I&#8217;ve constantly seen popping up in my life:</p>
<ol>
<li>Â <strong>The client-teacher relationship</strong>: What an honor to be hired and trusted by a client! Not only are you responsible for creating but you&#8217;re also just as responsible for teaching. You are doing a disservice to your client if you simply deliver your creation and walk away. You should be educating them on how to use it and how not to use it. It could be as formal as a style guide or as casual as a conversation</li>
<li><strong>The family-teacher relationship</strong>: You&#8217;re a designer. Everyone should know that. If that&#8217;s the case, then you should take the knowledge that you have attained and share it with your family (and friends)! Just as my uncle may lend advice regarding my renters insurance, I think it is my responsibility to tell him not to use comic sans for his client memos. It&#8217;s just the right thing to do.</li>
<li><strong>The stranger-teacher relationship</strong>: I have found this relationship to be the most rewarding because I don&#8217;t necessarily expect anything in return. There have been so many instances where I am able to share advice and tips with complete strangers regarding design. Some have resulted in clients but some haven&#8217;t. I constantly meet people in social or professional settings that are interested in a new website or branding but have no idea where to start. We should all be sharing our knowledge whether they want to hire you or not!</li>
</ol>
<p>After a great meeting with <a href="http://savvysexysocial.com/" target="_blank">Amy Schmittauer</a> last week, she was able to remind me that sharing is not a bad thing. Amy states, &#8220;When you share information about your industry to your audience and give it away (without expecting anything in return) you show authority.&#8221; She explained that there&#8217;s this misconception that if you give someone else valuable information, you won&#8217;t gain their business. I truly do believe that the opposite is true.</p>
<p>There are various ways in which you can be a teacher. Perhaps it&#8217;s starting or continuing a blog, offering to speak at a conference, giving seminars, connecting two likeminded people who can benefit from a relationship, or even starting a podcast.</p>
<p>What do you think? Do you think that designers are too quick to keep information to themselves? How can you incorporate this idea into your business? How far are you willing to talk to someone before you consider it consulting? I would love to hear your thoughts.</p>

								<p>I&#8217;m a developer by formation but I always had a passion for UX matters and now I chose the UX path. While I was a pure developer, I kept on sharing by having a personal blog and ALWAYS a personal area in the corporate wiki to share things among the company. Sharing in a company is crucial because an important turn over can lead to losing knowledge. Having a strong internal Knowledge Management system can sometimes save LOT of time.</p>
<p>But designers are magicians.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they have the feeling that sharing will destroy their magic by unveiling the trick. And then, they won&#8217;t be needed as anybody now can do it. Definitely, not. Designers&#8217; work does not interest other persons than designers or at least people for whom designing is important. So, they deserve to know!</p>

								<p>That&#8217;s a good thought to consider &#8211; &#8220;can I justify this design choice?&#8221;. There are many reasons such as for improved user experience, or to promote the brand etc. But many designers just work intuitively. That is part of their skill, but they have to be able to reason decisions with others and be able to articulate those ideas.</p>

								<p>I think Designer&#8217;s should share their knowledge very much often; we have the capacity to level up the quality of every product and piece showing around, then we would find better opportunities to bright for our edge and upstanding creative and artistic capabilities, instead of losing time explaining the basics of why comic sans insÂ´t the best choice.<br />
Ultimately that&#8217;s a personal choice that affect us as community.<br />

								<p>I find the idea of hiding knowledge very odd to begin with, even more so with designers. The way I see it, the more people understand good design, the more opportunities we have to push it forward and do something extra creative, instead of being stuck doing shiny buttons for the rest of our lives because that&#8217;s what people think good design is about. :)</p>
