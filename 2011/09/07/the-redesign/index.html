							<p>Welcome to the new <strong>xheight</strong>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a first time visitor or just not very observant, the &#8220;old&#8221; site was much the same as this except it sported the excellent <a title="iA³ Template for WordPress" href="http://store.informationarchitects.jp/product/ia%C2%B3-template" target="_blank">Information Architects iA³ WordPress theme</a> (what a design to match!)</p>
<p>Spurred on by exceptional community feedback since launch — and as a thank you to all authors and commenters — I decided to redesign xheight to give it a much deserved unique aesthetic and layout. A platform for future growth, if you will.</p>
<h2>The process</h2>
<p>The most fascinating part of this process was asking for feedback from all the <a title="xheight authors" href="/authors">xheight authors</a>. They are an exceptionally talented bunch working across the design industry (<a title="write an article for xheight" href="/write-for-us" target="_blank">you can join them</a>). It&#8217;s no lie to say I was a tad nervous, but perhaps unjustly so. It really warmed me to read their feedback, not because it was complementary — though most was — but because it was <em>real</em>, it was <em>thoughtful</em> feedback. The kind you wish clients were able to articulate.  I would have quickly scrapped what I was doing had the sentiment been negative. I&#8217;m glad that it wasn&#8217;t but I&#8217;m also happy with the knowledge that it <em>could</em> have been.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rare skill to be able to critique. To understand the brief and requirements. To remove thoughts that are too personal and to ignore the notion of <em>&#8220;am I hurting the designer&#8217;s feelings?&#8221;</em>. I&#8217;m very thankful to the xheight authors for their perfect insight.</p>
<p>Even though one does secretly hope for an online high-five, there&#8217;s really not much value in that. Design <em>is</em> subjective no matter how much we try to ignore the fact. That&#8217;s the whole point. Demographics are different; people are unique. It&#8217;s impossible to produce something that receives universal applause. The more people a design makes comfortable, the more generic and bland it becomes. It&#8217;s often said that &#8220;good design is invisible&#8221; but I think it&#8217;s more accurate to say that bad design is <em>noticeable</em>. So while this design may not be to everyone&#8217;s taste, it should sit nicely infront of those designers who like to read.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s who we like.</p>
<p>xheight&#8217;s value lies in the words written and this new design has one goal: make the articles as accessible and as readable as possible.</p>
<p>This is an evolving website. It will change in whatever way is best suited to discuss design. For now I am very excited with where we are heading.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

								<p>I think this new design is really lovely! Very very nice!</p>
<p>I have two comments:<br />
-The textarea I&#8217;m writing in right now has extremely small text, to the point where it&#8217;s pretty hard to read!  </p>
<p>-For some reason I&#8217;m not really digging the purple links.</p>
<p>Nice work :)</p>

								<p>Thanks for the comment. The purple links have caused some controversy! As for the text area here, I&#8217;ll probably bump the size up soon.</p>

								<p>You have succeeded.  This is one of the few sites I have not had to enlarge the text.  Tiny print I have to keep clicking for readable is a real turn off.</p>

								<p>Love the overall look &#8216;n feel of this. The color scheme and type hierarchy make each article a pleasant read.</p>
<p>One thing that&#8217;s been distracting me is how the navigation comes and goes based on mouse (but not keyboard?) movement. I know you said the readability is priority numero uno, but the design does a great job of preventing the nav &amp; ad from distracting while reading.</p>
<p>Not sure if anyone else feels this way.</p>

			<div class="text">
								<p>Well the thinking behind the fade out is that keyboard arrows up/down, and the mouse wheel or swipe should scroll the page without fading back in, only actual mouse movement fades the content back in.</p>
