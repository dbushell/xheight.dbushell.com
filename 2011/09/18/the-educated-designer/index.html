							<p>It&#8217;s a quiet Sunday morning and I&#8217;ve found myself thinking. Dangerous in itself I know, but the question that&#8217;s cranking my brain into motion this lovely sunny morning is on a whole new level:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Should <strong>web designers</strong> know how to code?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Boy, has that one caused debate in the web design community. It rises its head every few months to a frenzy of tweets, articles and comments. Here&#8217;s a brief run down of my favourite:</p>
<ul>

<li><a title="Do designers need to code?" href="http://csswizardry.com/2011/09/do-designers-need-to-code/" target="_blank">Harry Roberts - Do designers need to code?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The list could go on but at the risk of unearthing a monster I&#8217;ll go no further than to bullet point a few thoughts of my own:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to design a website without knowledge of web standards and coding practices. It&#8217;s <em>that</em> intrinsic to my process.</li>
<li>The designers and front-end developers I respect and admire the most all have something in common: they do both.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the thought I ponder most of all:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I can&#8217;t imagine why a professional web designer would choose not to learn coding.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Oh well, I guess I&#8217;ll have to explain that one&#8230;</p>
<h2>In Search of Creativity</h2>
<p>During my graphic design education I was introduced to many masters of the craft.</p>
<p>A man that stands out to me as someone of great influence and inspiration is the late <a title="Alan Fletcher (graphic designer) - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Fletcher_(graphic_designer)" target="_blank">Alan Fletcher</a>. His book <a title="The Art of Looking Sideways - Phaidon" href="http://www.phaidon.co.uk/store/general-non-fiction/alan-fletcher-the-art-of-looking-sideways-9780714834498/" target="_blank">The Art of Looking Sideways</a> is a tome of brilliance. If you don&#8217;t own it, every single page continues an unstoppable array of visual explorations, each one stirring a unique emotion. The book is a breathtaking collection that only a lifetime of wisdom could produce.</p>
<p>It is with memories of Alan Fletcher that I remind myself of where true creativity and motivation comes from: a worldly knowledge of experience and insight (and a desire for more). To avoid staying static, allowing inspiration to evaporate. To avoid becoming placid and boring. Now, that&#8217;s not to say that others should not crave the same (on the contrary, it&#8217;s what makes us human) but those of us in the creative fields — the artists, musicians, poets, and dare I say, <em>web designers</em> — all share an erratic excitement in this search for creativity and knowledge. But let&#8217;s <em>also</em> consider everybody else. A continuing education stimulates the mind, broadens career prospects and generally makes us more fun to be around.</p>
<p>It is with those thoughts that I ask, why would any web designer <em>choose</em> not to learn coding?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s such a natural progression. One not just of great value on a practical level, but also of great mind-opening knowledge. With such a useful skill so interesting, so different, and yet so intrinsically connected, how could anyone choose to remain ignorant and still continue to thrive as a designer?</p>
<p>I would expect <em>anyone</em> working on the web to have a basic understanding of HTML &amp; CSS but us &#8220;creatives&#8221; have an added incentive to keep our imaginations burning, and that can&#8217;t possibly be denied, can it? Even if we ignore questions of necessity, understanding the medium and the ability to collaborate, surely a designer cannot remain contempt with limited knowledge of their field?</p>
<p>I say go forth and learn what is around the corner, and don&#8217;t stop.</p>

								<p>I agree completely, learning and developing is crucial to our work. Doing so is natural, and for most people enjoyable. </p>
<p>Also, as you say, writing HTML/CSS is a natural thing to learn as someone involved in the web (I don&#8217;t think it should be limited to web designers, but anyone involved in some problem solving manner).<br />
However, the issue comes in prioritising the skills you could learn to develop yourself. Do you spend time learning and practicing HTML/CSS or do you spend that time learning more about psychology, or service design, or many many other things. </p>
<p>I personally think this is one of the most personal and most interesting parts of our industry, no two people have the same skill set, no two people want to learn the same things at the same times. </p>
<p>I feel that the value of learning HTML/CSS far out weighs the value of most areas, the time input is low, the discussion that can follow, the depth of knowledge that can be obtained, and the capabilities that are made available are brilliant.</p>

								<p>If I were to expand my article I&#8217;d write exactly that.</p>
<p>I think coding knowledge is so important that it should be considered a prerequisite to being a web designer. The other areas you&#8217;ve mentioned are also a part of an ongoing education. I&#8217;m forever reading books on social media and networking, eye tracking and analytics, user experience, design theory &#8211; there is never ending insight to be found.</p>
<p>Thanks Mark :)</p>

								<p>&#8220;It is with those thoughts that I ask, why would any web designer choose not to learn coding?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because a web designer is a designer and if he aspires to be a great one at it, then he should practice what is most important towards becoming one.</p>
<p>I am a programmer (as in software developer). I work with a designer, an animator, a web programming expert, a back end programmer and a sys-admin. They are all experts in what they do. Not just another someone. Just keeping up with the changes in one field takes up most of your life, let alone try to be an expert in other areas as well.</p>

								<p>I think you&#8217;re not considering how wide of a field &#8220;design&#8221; is. There are basic principles, but each design discipline requires understanding of the medium. Packaging designers need a strong understanding of printing techniques and materials. Web designers need a strong understanding of HTML &#038; CSS. That&#8217;s certainly not trying to be &#8220;an expert in other areas&#8221;. In fact, it&#8217;s that kind of knowledge that makes a <em>great</em> web designer.</p>

								<p>I just don&#8217;t understand how someone couldn&#8217;t have picked up at least the basics, even people who have no interest in web development often have a decent grasp of HTML/CSS. </p>
<p>If you use a computer then there are certain skills you just pick up, web developers might not need to use Photoshop but they still usually know the basics.</p>

								<p>I graduated as a graphic designer and I started my first job as a web designer&#8230; In the first company where I worked, the designer had to code the HTML/CSS due to lack of manpower, so having no choice I started picking up HTML/CSS skills there. </p>
<p>In the second company I was tasked as the HTML/CSS slicer, but eventually I find that in order to create truly interactive pages I need to learn Javascript. jQuery was one of the first things I learned, then I &#8220;reverse-engineered&#8221; myself to learn Javascript. Now I am a full-time front-end developer, also working very heavily with Javascript and NodeJS development.</p>
<p>And yes, I still dabble in design works from time to time, and I must say that it is true, once you&#8217;ve known how to code, it makes you a better designer because you will know what is implementable, what are the limits to push, and you can even describe and advice what are the best approaches in terms of development. </p>
<p>So I focused on technology and development a lot instead of the psychological side of design. Perhaps it&#8217;s a matter of choice? :)</p>

								<p>I used to think I didn&#8217;t need to learn how to code. I just thought I sliced everything up and then the web developer would take care of it. However, once I got out of school and into a real job, I realized how important HTML and CSS knowledge was and how it effects the layout and design of a website, email, or microsite. Knowing what works and what won&#8217;t work only makes the development process go smoother.</p>
