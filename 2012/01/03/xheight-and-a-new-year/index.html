							<p>Hello <em>Two Thousand and Twelve!</em></p>
<p>xheight is back and this year I&#8217;ll make sure it will be better than ever! Funny how often we make resolutions. It&#8217;s either that, or quip about how arbitrary a &#8220;date&#8221; really is. A condescending laugh at those who endeavour, or an unwitting admittance of no ambition, I wonder?</p>
<p>For me at least, January <em>does</em> feel special. I don&#8217;t care what anyone else thinks! This year will be my best yet. I have no plans, no targets, no deadlines — only the one vague ambition to out perform previous efforts. To be honest I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be much of a challenge! Every month I feel proud of what I&#8217;ve achieved and yet I often look back and say &#8220;man, I wish I was as good then as I am now&#8221;. Am I too hard on myself?</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel king of the world! Other times I feel wasted. It seems to relate directly to recent events. If I&#8217;ve done something productive I want to keep that ball rolling. If I&#8217;ve been lazy (even on a well deserved break) I feel like I&#8217;ve fallen behind life&#8217;s schedule. So it would seem my answer is to never stay still and avoid complacency. Difficult for a guy who enjoys nothing more than being mindlessly sprawled across furniture. But then I&#8217;ve never done anything the easy way.</p>
<p>The arrival of a new year is a great time for reflection regardless of whether it&#8217;s ever corresponded to events in your life. We generally subscribe to the calendar so that we <em>can</em> pinpoint moments, milestones, times of thought, and the beginnings of resolutions. Why not take on a fresh perspective alongside everyone else? I rarely start the year with a specific plan but I always endeavour to achieve more and that has always worked out just fine. Changes and achievements happen through an ambitious determination even when ideas are not immediately apparent. I just make note of them on memorable occasions like this. I don&#8217;t set out for glory and don&#8217;t see myself as anything special, I simply expect more from myself every year. Confirming to myself that I will overcome the challenges that arise and excel at whatever takes my interest is enough of a resolution for me.</p>
<p>As a designer I think this mindset is particularly important. Much of my talent and ability comes from experience and experimentation. They deliver serendipity and I can&#8217;t go looking for that, but I can progress forward and stumble into it.</p>
<p>I have no idea how xheight came into being but it happened early last year! I&#8217;m eternally grateful to all those <a title="xheight authors" href="/authors/" target="_blank">authors</a> who joined me along the way and I look forward to meeting newcomers too. They make this blog a pleasure to host. Next week we have an article by <strong><a title=".net Awards 2011: the winners!" href="http://www.netmagazine.com/features/net-awards-2011-winners" target="_blank">2011 .net award</a></strong> winning designer <a title="Janna Hagan" href="http://www.jannahagan.com/" target="_blank">Janna Hagan</a> — make sure to subscribe!</p>
<p>Now, what&#8217;s your resolution? And don&#8217;t say 1440×900 :)</p>
