									<h2><a href="/2012/08/08/a-final-word/">A Final Word</a></h2>
									<p>Welcome to the archived xheight — a collaborative blog that ran throughout 2011. This blog with see no further updates, but it will remain online and accessible in its preserved form. If this is your first visit I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find something interesting to read. xheight started with no particular agenda other than to provide [...]</p>

									<h2><a href="/2012/01/09/exercising-the-mind/">Exercising the Mind</a></h2>
									<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve been exploring the deeper meanings behind our work and defining who we are as designers. One of the prevalent themes I&#8217;ve been researching is how one &#8220;designs their mindset.&#8221; Strengthening our conscience with regular and daily exercise can serve us a well-rounded and purposeful life, comparative to running a marathon and the desirable [...]</p>

									<h2><a href="/2012/01/03/xheight-and-a-new-year/">xheight and a New Year</a></h2>
									<p>Hello Two Thousand and Twelve! xheight is back and this year I&#8217;ll make sure it will be better than ever! Funny how often we make resolutions. It&#8217;s either that, or quip about how arbitrary a &#8220;date&#8221; really is. A condescending laugh at those who endeavour, or an unwitting admittance of no ambition, I wonder? For me at least, [...]</p>

									<h2><a href="/2011/12/19/turning-the-light-back-on/">Turning the Light Back On</a></h2>
									<p>I have ideas. They appear at random and I try to write them down before I forget. I like to think the difference between an idea and a thought is that an idea is often followed by a refreshing sense of relief. It always seems like the most exhilarating ideas are the hardest to pen down. [...]</p>

									<h2><a href="/2011/11/14/every-pixel-matters/">Every Pixel Matters</a></h2>
									<p>When you&#8217;re starting to set your goals, you want to have it perfect right? So does everybody else. The first time I decided to resign from the company I&#8217;ve work for and go freelance I imagined that the road would be easy and that I could design whatever I wanted. Well, it hasn&#8217;t worked out [...]</p>

									<h2><a href="/2011/10/31/nostalgia/">Nostalgia</a></h2>
									<p>A lot of people get nostalgic when faced with the often intrusive evolution of technology. Partly it&#8217;s down to our willingness and ability to change; our adaptiveness. New things can be overwhelming, too complex to justify upgrading from the current norm. I often find myself saying &#8220;What does this solve? I don&#8217;t have a problem [...]</p>

									<h2><a href="/2011/10/17/learning-to-freelance/">Learning to freelance</a></h2>
									<p>It’s been 1½ year since I left my position as Creative Director for a stellar agency in Utah and started freelancing full time. Over the course of that time I’ve been lucky enough to have some awesome clients around the world. While I do miss my old co-workers and crew, it’s been an unbelievable ride. [...]</p>

									<h2><a href="/2011/10/03/storytelling-in-design/">Storytelling in Design</a></h2>
									<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to prove to the world that with enough hard work, strong dedication, and a little bit of patience &#8211; anyone can achieve anything they want to achieve. It has been done and proven a thousand times before by those who are now our worlds most inspirational figures, and I want to be next. This is an [...]</p>

									<h2><a href="/2011/09/26/respecting-ethics/">Respecting Ethics</a></h2>
									<p>Merriam Webster defines ethics as: &#8220;a set of moral principles : a theory or system of moral values&#8221; I think we can all agree that&#8217;s a pretty accurate description of what we understand by ethics. But right of the bat, there&#8217;s a problem. Ethics is defined as a theory or system. But we have neither. [...]</p>

									<h2><a href="/2011/09/18/the-educated-designer/">The Educated Designer</a></h2>
									<p>It&#8217;s a quiet Sunday morning and I&#8217;ve found myself thinking. Dangerous in itself I know, but the question that&#8217;s cranking my brain into motion this lovely sunny morning is on a whole new level: &#8220;Should web designers know how to code?&#8221; Boy, has that one caused debate in the web design community. It rises its [...]</p>
