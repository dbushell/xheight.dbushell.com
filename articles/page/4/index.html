									<h2><a href="/2011/04/18/you-start-here/">You start here</a></h2>
									<p>When I was young I thought the whole world included only my area, my friends, and my family. Years later I learned the truth about how truly vast this wondrous planet is. It is the source of my greatest inspirations, the cause of some of my worst pains, and yet it is why I strive to [...]</p>

									<h2><a href="/2011/04/11/design-is-life/">Design is Life</a></h2>
									<p>Design is life. I always liked to believe that I was meant for a lot more than what my societies perception of life thought it should be like. I come from a culture with very little appreciation for passion and the arts, and from a very young age I knew deep down in my heart [...]</p>

									<h2><a href="/2011/04/07/what-makes-me-sick/">What makes me sick</a></h2>
									<p>Begin. I feel I must begin this slight dissertation on my methods with a confession and a lament. When David approached me to join xheight, my heart grew with excitement and a sense of emotional relief upon the idea of a place whence my more abstract thoughts on design could find residence. These feelings were [...]</p>

									<p>xheight is now officially live. When I first dreamt of this project I had no idea how warm the reception would be. When contacting designers I struggled to explain the plan but still there was resounding positivity, regardless of the words I chose. Though I&#8217;ve initiated this project, it&#8217;s success relies on the generosity of [...]</p>

									<h2><a href="/2011/03/20/welcome-to-xheight/">welcome to xheight</a></h2>

There are massive publications giving superb practical advice, and there are small personal blogs, quietly influencing other inquisitive designers lucky enough to know of them. xheight aims to share the inner-most secrets of professional designers.

									<h2><a href="/2011/03/16/what-does-design-mean-to-you/">What does design mean to you?</a></h2>
									<p>This article was originally posted at dbushell.com to announce xheight. I write a lot about my experiences as a professional Web Designer. Writing helps shape my understanding. Sometimes I’ll start writing on a topic only to realise I know less than I thought I did. What fascinates me more though is reading what other designers have to [...]</p>
